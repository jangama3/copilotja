	   <h1> Certification Types </h1>
	  
	  	<p id="StudentPilot"> <strong> Student Pilot Certificate </strong> – A student pilot certificate gives authentication for you to <br>take flight instruction from a licensed instructor. This is the first part toward earning a <br>P.P.L.. To obtain a Student Pilot Certificate, allowing you to pursue flight training, you need to <br>meet basic eligibility requirements. First, you must be 16 years of age. (If you intend <br>to pilot a glider or balloon, you must be 14 years old.) As well, you must be able to <br>proficiently read, speak, and understand English. English has been designated as <br>the universal language in aviation.

		<p id="PrivatePilot"> <strong> Private Pilot License </strong> – The most common type of pilot license 			issued <br>by the FAA. In order to gain your FAA private pilot license you must log a minimum of 35 hours of <br>verified flight time while passing the written tests, pass the FAA check-ride, and contain a valid drivers license. <br>An F.A.A. P.P.L. certificate allows you to fly in most single-engine airplanes and aircraft, <br> some additional instrument rating tests may be required for more advanced aircraft or if <br>you wish to be rated to fly under Instrument Flight Rules (I.F.R.). With a PPL, you are authorized <br>to fly alone or with other people, but you may not receive compensation for flying or taking people <br>on flights.

You must be at <br>least 23 years old, have a valid drivers license, pass all exams and tests, pass the flight exams, <br>log more than 1500 hours of 	flight time (in the U.S.) in various weather conditions and in numerous <br>types of aircraft, pass the I.R. courses and ground school courses, pass all medical and eye exams, <br>and be of sound body, mind and execution.
